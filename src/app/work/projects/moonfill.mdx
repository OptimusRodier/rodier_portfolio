## Overview

Moonfill is a lightweight browser extension developed to automate repetitive tasks for the internal **Awin Global Integration** team.  
It seamlessly integrates with Salesforce to detect **Awin advertiser records**, extract key fields like the **MID** and **Country of the program**, and prefill a Microsoft Office form used by the integration team.

The tool eliminates manual copy‚Äìpaste routines and reduces form completion time from minutes to seconds ‚Äî improving accuracy and consistency across teams.

## Key Features

### üß† Context-Aware Detection
Moonfill automatically detects when users are viewing a Salesforce record. Once the page is ready, it scans the DOM for relevant Awin fields such as the **Advertiser ID (MID)** and **Country of the program**, applying internal GEO logic to convert the country name into an international region code.

### üé® Seamless UI Integration
Moonfill includes a polished **HTML popup interface** that appears when users click the extension icon.  
The popup allows users to manually enter the **MID**, select the **Region Geo Code** from a dropdown, and click a prominent **‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù** button to trigger the data injection.

When a valid record is detected from the URL, Moonfill injects a visually integrated button directly into the Salesforce interface.

The button sits naturally within the Salesforce card layout and allows one-click submission of prefilled forms.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Smart Validation
If the detected MID is invalid or shorter than 3 digits, Moonfill automatically disables interaction and shows a neutral grey state to prevent accidental submissions.

### üöÄ One-Click Automation
Upon activation, Moonfill opens the pre-configured Microsoft Form, fills in the relevant advertiser data, and submits automatically after confirming that all required fields are valid.  
The form includes live validation logic and even detects the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù confirmation message before closing the tab ‚Äî ensuring a clean, uninterrupted workflow.

### üíæ Persistent Local Storage
Advertiser ID (MID) and GEO data are cached using Chrome‚Äôs local storage API to maintain quick access and cross-tab consistency without privacy risk.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)** ‚Äî Core logic and event handling  
- **Chrome Extension APIs** ‚Äî For background messaging, DOM injection, and storage  
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äî Clean UI components styled to match Awin‚Äôs design language  
- **Microsoft Forms** ‚Äî Target form for automation and submission  
- **Session Storage** ‚Äî Used to store intermediate data during automation flow

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing a plugin that operates inside Salesforce‚Äôs dynamic and shadow-DOM-heavy environment required deep understanding of asynchronous DOM rendering.  
Moonfill uses smart polling and conditional retries to detect when Salesforce elements are fully available before injecting its components.

Balancing reliability with performance ‚Äî ensuring the button only appears when relevant fields exist ‚Äî was one of the most rewarding aspects of the project.

## Outcome

Moonfill has reduced average Moonpull form submission time by **over 80%**, helping the integration team optimize efficiency while maintaining data accuracy.  
The tool has become a trusted internal assistant and continues to evolve with user feedback, supporting the wider automation goals across the Awin ecosystem.
